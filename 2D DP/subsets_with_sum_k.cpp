// You are given an array 'arr' of size 'n' containing positive integers and a target sum 'k'.
// Find the number of ways of selecting the elements 
// from the array such that the sum of chosen elements is equal to the target 'k'.
// Since the number of ways can be very large, print it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.
